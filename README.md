Pose Detection Project By (Tanu Chauhan and Amey Pathak)
Overview

This project aims to detect and analyze human poses in images and videos using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Pose detection is a fundamental task in computer vision with applications ranging from gesture recognition to human-computer interaction.
Features

    Pose Detection: Detect human body poses in images and videos.
    Multi-Person Pose Detection: Detect poses of multiple individuals simultaneously.
    Pose Analysis: Analyze detected poses for further processing, such as gesture recognition or activity classification.
    Real-time Processing: Achieve real-time pose detection for live video streams.
    Easy Integration: Simple APIs for integration with other projects or applications.
